## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS][tailwinddocs]
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs) - for simple static site building

### What I learned

From previous feedback and looking at feedback of other solutions, I understood I needed to focus more on my markup. I was setting up the markup to focus on styling and the design outcome and not the pertinent content. This time I focused on the content and how to represent that content through the markup.

I also was able to learn some techniques in styling tables and lists, along with navigating the defaults of Tailwind to leverage my styling the way I want it to look.

### Continued development

I need to focus more on the content in the markup and putting styles together with a mobile first perspective and workflow.
